At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was  kicked out of Apple's App Store  last summer for flouting its rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.  Apple   (  AAPL  )  gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite's removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple.  On day one, Epic and its first witness — the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney — sought to establish that Apple's App Store and its refusal to allow other app stores on its platform constitute anti-competitive behavior. The company argued that Apple's strict control of its iOS ecosystem — referred to as a \"walled garden\" — constitutes a monopoly and are calling on the iPhone maker to allow alternative app stores, and potentially apps, on its devices outside of its own and what it approves.              \"Epic is solely seeking changes to Apple's future behavior\" and not any financial damages, Sweeney said during his testimony.                Epic v. Apple: The legal challenge that could remake the future of the digital economy      Apple argues that allowing apps on its devices that are not subject to its restrictions would compromise the security and privacy of its ecosystem — features it has emphasized as selling points. Additionally, it argues that it is competing in a massive video game market of which it is only a small part, therefore it has no monopoly and cannot abuse such a position.    Read More     Much of the day's proceedings were centered around both companies trying to frame how they define their businesses. Sweeney described Fortnite as a \"metaverse\" and a \"social experience\" — a virtual world with movies, TV shows and concerts beyond just gameplay.  Defining the market is key to any potential antitrust case. It's not illegal to have a monopoly under US law; it's only illegal to try to preserve a monopoly at the expense of competition. Apple is seeking to establish that its operating system, iOS, competes with several other platforms and thus doesn't run afoul of antitrust law.  Epic says Apple uses iOS to lock users and developers into a restrictive environment where it then charges them hefty fees for additional transactions. An Epic   lawyer, Katherine Forrest, at one point likened Apple to a car dealership that charges customers every time they fill their cars with gas.  Apple pushed back on accusations of anti-competitive behavior by focusing on the gaming industry, arguing that Fortnite is available on several other major platforms including personal computers, Google's Android operating system and even Epic's own online game store, as well as popular video game consoles such as Sony's PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and the Nintendo Switch. Users of all those platforms can play Fortnite against each other, and largely make in-app purchases on one platform to use on another, Apple argued.  \"Epic is asking for government intervention to take away a choice that consumers currently have,\" Karen Dunn, a lawyer for Apple, said during her opening statement.            Tim Cook and other Apple executives will testify against Epic in Fortnite trial      Another Apple lawyer, Richard Doren, pointed out during his cross examination of Sweeney that Epic pays the console platforms a similar 30% fee, even though those platforms also don't allow external apps or alternative payment methods. Sweeney argued that consoles, which lose money on hardware sales and make it up with software, have a different business model than Apple's profitable app store.  Several other big names are expected to testify in the coming days, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and a representative for  Microsoft   (  MSFT  ) .    The judge's ruling — and, of course, the appeals that will almost certainly follow — could have huge ramifications not only for Apple and its iOS ecosystem, but potentially for other app stores and the overall app economy, which has grown to hundreds of billions of dollars and supports millions of jobs. It's a case that could either transform the way many in-app purchases work, or entrench the power tech platforms have to set the rules of an increasingly digital world.   Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the witnesses set to testify. Representatives from Facebook are not expected to take the stand.

        "content": "  Are These The Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy Right Now?   Among the various sectors in the  stock market , consumer discretionary stocks appear to be gaining momentum as investors anticipate booming economic growth through the rest of the year. With the rate of vaccines being administered in the U.S., it would lead to a speedy reopening of the nation’s economy. And that bodes well for  top consumer discretionary stocks . This sector comprises companies that sell goods and services that are considered non-essential. Some of the biggest names in the sector would include Home Depot Inc ( NYSE: HD ), Nike Inc ( NYSE: NKE ), and even Apple Inc ( NASDAQ: AAPL ). As some of you would expect, companies within this sector tend to be more volatile as they rise and fall with broader economic trends.   With COVID-19 seemingly subsiding in the U.S., it’s natural that some sectors that were previously battered by the pandemic are seeing strong rebounds in the demand for their products and services. After all, with tens of millions of people getting vaccinated against the insidious virus in the U.S., people are spending more time outdoors again. And that makes many top consumer discretionary stocks potentially worth buying, creating huge opportunities for many investors. If you’re a believer in the economic recovery narrative, do you have this list of  top consumer discretionary stocks to buy  in the stock market today?     Top Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Watch     Pinduoduo Inc  ( NASDAQ: PDD )   McDonald’s Corp  ( NYSE: MCD )   Starbucks Corporation  ( NASDAQ: SBUX )   Tenneco Inc  ( NYSE: TEN )    Pinduoduo Inc   Pinduoduo is a Chinese e-commerce platform operator. Its mobile e-commerce platform provides value-for-money merchandise and interactive shopping options. PDD stock has been quite impressive over the past year. It has more than doubled in price during this period.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Last week, the company announced its first-quarter earnings report. Its revenue spiked by 239% to $3.4 billion compared to the prior year’s quarter. Out of which, the online marketing services and others contributed $2.15 billion, an increase of 157%. In addition, there was also an increase of 31% in active buyers, now at 823.8 million. Given that China’s new three-child policy has come into play, these numbers could improve as time goes by.    Ever since its IPO back in 2018, the company has slowly emerged as a legitimate challenger to Alibaba Group ( NYSE: BABA ) and JD.com Inc ( NASDAQ: JD ) in the Chinese e-commerce space. Many attribute this to Pinduoduo’s relentless growth and increasing popularity of its business model. That said, PDD stock has retraced by more than 30% from its peak back in February. So, could this be a perfect opportunity to load up on PDD stock?    [Read More]   3 Value Stocks To Watch Right Now    McDonald’s Corp    Next, we have one of the leading fast-food restaurants in the world, McDonald’s. Now, who doesn’t know McDonald’s? It serves a locally relevant menu of food and drinks at more than 39 thousand restaurants in over 119 markets globally. After its sell-off back in March 2020, MCD stock has been on an upward trajectory. In the past year, the stock has soared by almost 25%.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS In April, the company posted its first-quarter earnings report. Global comparable sales increased 7.5% and consolidated revenues increased by 9%. Also, consolidated earnings increased by 35% which includes the $135 million related to the sale of McDonald’s Japan stock. If we were to exclude these, then net operating income would be an increase of 27%. As we can see, the company has begun to lap the significant impact of COVID-19 on its global results beginning in March 2020.    On top of that, McDonald’s also announced it will increase the allocation of advertising dollars to diverse-owned media companies, production houses, and content creators over the next four years. This would help bolster individual businesses while creating deeper relationships with McDonald’s diverse customer base. With that in mind, would you consider buying MCD stock?    Read More     4 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Right Now    Trending Tech Stocks To Buy This Week? 4 To Know     Starbucks Corporation   Starbucks Corporation operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. Its stores offer coffee and tea beverages, roasted whole bean and ground coffees, single-serve and ready-to-drink beverages, and various food products. Starbucks operates more than 32,000 stores worldwide, a figure which has doubled over the past decade. Fortunately for its investors, the company’s stock also follows the same trajectory. In fact, SBUX stock has almost doubled in price just within the past year.    Source: TD Ameritrade TOS In April, the company reported its fiscal second-quarter 2021 results. The company appears to be recovering from the impact of the pandemic. In particular, global comparable store sales for the quarter were up by 15%, largely driven by a 19% increase in the average amount of sales per customer. To top it off, GAAP earnings per share were $0.56, doubling from the prior year. This demonstrates an impressive momentum in its business with sales recovery and illustrates its ability to adapt to changes posed by the pandemic.   These are exciting times for the company as it focuses on international store growth. With plans of reducing the number of stores in the U.S., it plans to open 95% of its new stores internationally in the fiscal year 2021. This would likely improve its operating margins as store operation expenses are lower in the international segment. All things considered, is SBUX stock a top consumer discretionary stock to buy?    [Read More]   Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now? 5 Electric Vehicle Stocks To Watch    Tenneco Inc   To sum up the list, we have Tenneco Inc.

It will be supplying to all NASCAR Cup Series teams a highly advanced, five-way adjustable version of the popular Ӧhlins TTR coil-over damper. This further illustrates that the company’s strong heritage in racing has gained the recognition it deserves.    Back in May, the company reported its first-quarter financial results.

        "content": "     Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak has been sued over the theft of a business idea from a professor.  Ralph Reilly approached Wozniak about making a branded tech school in 2010 but it didn't pan out.  Wozniak later made one without Reilly, and said \"I doubt it would have happened\" without his idea.   See more stories on Insider's business page .   In early 2011, at a luncheon at Sacramento's Hyatt Regency hotel, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak clasped hands with a Connecticut business professor named Ralph Reilly.  According to Reilly, the pair had agreed to establish a futuristic \"tech university,\" sealing the deal with an on-camera handshake. It was an ambitious plan for a 21-century educational platform to teach adults much-needed technical skills, using Wozniak's name and legendary status as cofounder of the world's most iconic computing company to brand the institution.  But Wozniak has a different recollection. The veteran engineer often known as \"Woz\" has said the meeting was one of dozens of photo-ops he conducts on a near-daily basis with his fans and admirers — so mundane he doesn't even remember the photograph being taken.  Despite further emails and meetings, the partnership never got off the ground — and has erupted into a million-dollar lawsuit, Insider has learned. Reilly alleges that Wozniak stole his intellectual property and infringed on his copyright by launching a Woz-branded tech school without him, while Wozniak's team counters that he never had a real deal with Reilly and that he's inundated with business proposals from admirers.  The yearslong legal proceedings offer a rare window into the life of Apple's second-most-famous founder, as well as how tech celebs can cash in on their reputations with lucrative deals and partnerships for decades — and how it can all go wrong.  Such lawsuits are common in the chaotic world of startups, as entrepreneurs and business partners litigate over ownership and execution. And Wozniak's celebrity status, friendly manner, and hands-off approach to business appears to blur the line between business deal and fan interaction.  The copyright infringement case is set to go to trial in June in Arizona, and Wozniak has been called to the stand to testify.   From Apple cofounder to laid-back entrepreneur   Despite decades of entrepreneurship, Steve Wozniak says he has little control over his business dealings — a claim central to his defense.  The Apple cofounder takes a determinedly hands-off approach to business endeavours, leaving contract negotiations to business partners, like his manager Ken Hardesty, he said in a legal deposition ahead of the trial. So when lawyers asked Wozniak whether he received a $1 million payout for his association with Woz U, the school later started without Reilly, he couldn't say for sure whether he was ever paid for the deal, or even how much money he has. (In a separate deposition, Hardesty confirmed Wozniak got the cash.)  \"One thing I avoid in life is anything having to do with money,\" he said. \"I just don't look at it ... I wouldn't know how much is in our bank account. My life is very different than most people.\"  This unusual life dates to the 1970s, when Woz helped spark the personal-computing revolution.   He was one of the three creators of Apple Computer Company in 1976, along with the late Steve Jobs and the lesser-known Ronald Wayne. The then 25-year-old Californian was the key engineering mind behind some of its earliest products, including the Apple I and II computers.      Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with then-CEO John Sculley, center. AP   In the years since Woz parted ways with the company in 1985, Apple has grown from high-end computer maker to unassailable corporate titan — redefining tech and society with products ranging from the iPod to the iPhone. And as Apple's star has risen, so has Wozniak and his associations with the now legendary Jobs.  Wozniak, 70, has kept busy in the decades since. He's done philanthropy work, become a regular on the technology industry conference circuit, and jumped from project to project, offering business partners the prestige of working with an Apple cofounder. (He did not respond to a request for comment.)  In 2017,  he became an advisor to hologram emoji startup Mojiit , and in late 2020 he helped spin up Efforce, a blockchain startup focused on \"energy efficiency\" that calls its tradable tokens \"WOZX.\"   Wozniak even made an appearance on \"Dancing With The Stars\" in 2009, bedecked in a feathery pink boa.  'Woz has hundreds of fans like you, who have met him somewhere'  In January 2012, Reilly and Wozniak met for the second time, at the San Francisco office of the Apollo Group, which runs the for-profit college University of Phoenix. Reilly hoped that Apollo would help turn his idea into a reality.  Apollo (which is now called Apollo Education Group, and is distinct from the asset management giant of the same name) proposed its own licensing agreement with Wozniak, which would let the school use his name and image, and would require the tech executive to record two lectures to broadcast to the entire school, according to a pitch deck included in Reilly's complaint.   But for the time-crunched Wozniak, even two recorded lectures was two too many. \"Nothing ever came out of it,\" Hardesty, Wozniak's business manager, said in a deposition. \"It was a meeting. It was a meet and greet.\" Wozniak would later claim that he didn't even remember Reilly being in the room.   It was a disappointing outcome for the University of Hartford professor.  Reilly, an associate professor of management, keeps a low public profile. His online biography cites unspecified \"broad business experience in technical industries and diverse teaching experience,\" and a background in computer science. A lawyer for Reilly declined to comment about his background or the case.      Mock-ups for a proposed Woz Institute of Technology. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF ARIZONA   The academic had first broached the possibility of a Woz university with the Apple cofounder via email one Sunday evening in September 2010. \"Steve Woz, I really want to start a high tech university, any thoughts!?\" he wrote, according to copies of the emails included in court filings.  Wozniak, who prides himself on being accessible to his fans, emailed back within a couple of hours. He was too busy to help, he wrote, but offered the Connecticuter some advice. \"Great idea. It will take some time but do it right.\"  Reilly was emboldened by Woz's attention, and followed up a few days later with a bigger, more specific proposal. \"Would you consider endorsing the idea of ME starting the Woz Institute of Technology?\" he wrote on September 22, 2010.  \"Cool…ok to use name...\" Woz replied in an email included in the court documents. \"I'll get more involved eventually but right now life is crammed.\"  The pair would continue to go back and forth over a period of months as Reilly searched for a college to make the Woz Institute of Technology a reality.   At first it seemed like it might work out with an online school in Connecticut that Reilly had connections to through his son's t-ball team. While in Sacramento for the 2011 meet-and-greet, Reilly presented Wozniak with a contract that granted the college the right to use his name and image for the \"Woz School of Technology\" in exchange for quarterly payments.   Six dotted lines bore the same signature: \"Woz.\" In his deposition, Wozniak said he didn't remember signing it but didn't dispute it was his signature. \"It probably wasn't important enough to even remember,\" he said. \"I don't do business. If there's any business, you're going to have to go through my business partners.\"      A contract signed by Wozniak to establish a Wozniak-branded educational program. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF ARIZONA   When that plan didn't work out, Reilly probed Wozniak about whether he should find another institution to work with, leading to a key email at the center of Reilly's eventual claim that Wozniak stole his intellectual property. \"I have no time so whatever you want to try,\" Wozniak wrote in December 2011. \"I figure it's your idea.\"   Early the following year they met with Apollo together, but that didn't pan out either.  By early 2013, Wozniak's team was backing away from any possible partnership with Reilly. Hardesty emailed the professor demanding that he take down a mock-up website for the Woz Institute of Technology, denying there was a \"Original Plan or Joint Venture ever discussed,\" and telling him to stop contacting Wozniak directly.  \"Please realize Woz has hundreds of fans like you, who have met him somewhere, when he has a break for a little time, he likes to meet and talk with fans, then a short time later 90% of his fans start e-mailing with business ideas,\" Hardesty wrote curtly. \"At times, he tries to meet with everyone he can, you were a lucky one.\"  Reilly had obtained copyright protection for the website mock-up, and it is now at the heart of the case — even as Wozniak's lawyers counter that there's no evidence that Wozniak ever even looked at it.   The birth of Woz U   In the fall of 2017, Wozniak unveiled Woz U, a new plan to reinvent higher education in technology.  Despite the Wozniak brand, Woz U was built on top of existing code-learning company Coder Camps. The program billed itself as a skill-focused educational program to help students learn the fundamentals to move into the industry.   \"My entire life I have worked to build, develop and create a better world through technology and I have always respected education,\"  Wozniak said in the announcement . \"Now is the time for Woz U, and we are only getting started.\"  One name not mentioned in the announcement: Ralph Reilly.   Headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, Woz U went on to announce an array of educational programs including partnerships with tech companies to recruit new talent, and plans for 30 physical campuses acr"

The rare admission is part of Apple's defense in an ongoing lawsuit brought by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games.   Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories .   Apple's computers, from its iconic iMac to the latest MacBook, are getting slammed by   malware   and viruses.  That's according to Apple senior VP Craig Federighi's sworn testimony given on Wednesday in a California court room. \"Today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don't find acceptable,\" he said.  For every virus or piece of malware that Apple is able to stop or block, another several pop up. \"It's an endless game of whack-a-mole,\" he said.  Federighi appeared as a witness for the defense in an ongoing lawsuit brought against Apple by \"Fortnite\" maker   Epic Games   .  During questioning, Federighi compared the differences in security of Apple's computing platforms.      Apple's latest version of the iconic iMac all-in-one desktop computer. Apple   Apple's computers are \"like a car,\" he said, and that means users can take it off-road or wherever they'd like — for better or worse — whereas the iPhone and iPad operating system, iOS, needs to be usable by children and even babies.  In the lawsuit, Epic is attempting to force Apple to open its iOS platform to alternate app stores.  Epic argues that iOS is a computer operating system and should be open to competition. Apple argues that allowing alternative app stores introduces major security issues.   The Mac operating system, Federighi said, is less secure than iOS specifically because of its open nature. If you were able to download iPhone and iPad apps outside of Apple's App Store, Federighi said, you'd be open to a variety of security issues that Apple couldn't review before use.   This is due to the App Store's review process, he said, which offers a standard of safety across all iPhone and iPad apps.     Read more:   Bill Gates and Warren Buffett got 211 billionaires to pledge half their wealth to charity. Now some are falling short — and still getting massive tax breaks.    Epic Games filed suit against Apple last summer after its hit game, \"Fortnite,\" was  pulled from Apple's App Store .  Apple says it pulled the game because Epic violated the terms of its developer agreement when Epic implemented a payment system in the game that enabled players to circumvent Apple's App Store. Epic says the App Store is a monopoly, and argues that iPhones and iPads are no different from computers.  The in-person trial began in early May at the US District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland, California, and is expected to conclude next Monday.

        "content": "     Apple suppliers have used thousands of Uyghur Muslims in forced labor programs in China, The Information reports.  China has been accused of genocide of the minority group, detaining them in internment camps.  Apple in the past has denied using suppliers who rely on forced labor in China.   See more stories on Insider's business page .   Seven of Apple's suppliers were found to be linked to suspected forced labor of Uyghur Muslims and other persecuted groups sourced from the Xinjiang region, according to an investigation by  The Information.   Apple has previously denied using suppliers that rely on the forced labor of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group that has faced persecution in China. The Information's investigation suggests the use of forced labor by some of Apple's largest suppliers is more widespread than previously reported.  Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  As the Information notes, just one of the suppliers is in Xinjiang, the western region of China that consists predominately of the Uyghur Muslim population, which is native to the area. Other workers were shipped from Xinjiang to companies like Luxshare, which is one of Apple's biggest Chinese suppliers, according to records viewed by the outlet.  Avary Holding, which makes circuit boards for Apple devices in the Chinese city of Huai'an, added 400 Xinjiang labor workers to its workforce between 2019 and 2020 at one of its factories, per the report. Avary denied those claims to The Information. And Shenzhen Deren Electronic, which has made antennas and internal cables for Apple, has taken in 1,000 labor workers from Xinjiang, according to the report.  The outlet also viewed a video produced by AcBel Polytech, one of the suppliers, that shows how the company used forced labor from Xinjiang workers sometime between late 2018 and early 2019.  Apple does not publicly list the suppliers that it works with, but the publication verified their links to the company through official documents as well as through current employees at the suppliers. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and other companies were also linked to the suppliers in question, according to The Information.  One supplier, Lens Technology, which has provided Apple with glass for iPhones, has received 600 workers from Xinjiang since 2018, according to The Information. Apple responded to  a previous report of Lens using forced Uyghur laborers  in December saying, in part, it has \"zero tolerance for forced labor\" and did not find any evidence that Uyghurs were sent to the supplier's facilities.    Read more:   It's clear the US does not care about China's face anymore     A March 2020 report  from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute also  found connections between Apple suppliers and forced Uyghur labor.   Human Rights Watch estimates  1 million Uyghur Muslims are being persecuted in China . The country has detained them in internment camps, forcing them to abandon their culture for Chinese customs, like learning the Mandarin language.   China has pushed back on the characterization of the camps, claiming they are for \"reeducation\" purposes and calling Uyghur Muslims  terrorists and religious extremists , as Business Insider's Alexandra Ma reported.  If they refuse to participate in the work camps, they are sent to jail. Reports have surfaced of torture at these camps, including one woman who said  she witnessed a gang rape and medical experiments  on the prisoners while she was teaching Chinese propaganda in the camps. The government has also  been accused of sterilizing Uyghur women.   International human rights advocates and countries around the world have condemned China's actions. Human Rights Watch said in April that  China is committing \"crimes against humanity\"  through its prison centers for Uyghurs.   Read the full report on The Information here.     "

The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a new record high Thursday as stocks pegged to the reopening of the economy got a boost from new labor-market data.  The blue-chips index pushed higher with retailer  Home Depot  and consumer products giant  Procter &amp; Gamble  among the best performing shares. Companies with exposure to economic recovery have largely advanced this year on the back of data showing the world's largest economy is improving after the recession brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Labor Department on Thursday said jobless claims   totaled an unadjusted level of 498,000   last week. That was less than the 538,000 claims expected, on average, by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The reading marked a new low for the pandemic era and was the fourth consecutive weekly decline.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended higher, though was in the red for most of the day.  Hilary Kramer, chief investment officer at Kramer Capital Research, noted that tech stocks are still struggling even as borrowing costs as implied by the 10-year Treasury yield have fallen below 1.6% after hitting 14-months highs above 1.7% earlier this year.  Nasdaq \"valuations are completely out of whack with where we are with Main Street,\" she told Insider on Thursday. \"We have help-wanted signs everywhere from restaurants to mechanics shops ... and what's going to happen is people are going to stop spending.\" She added that these pressures are being pulled forward to put the squeeze on tech stocks.

        "content": "  Top Robinhood Stocks That Are Trending In The Stock Market Now   Finding the  best stocks to buy  on Robinhood has become extremely popular among all types of investors. At its core, Robinhood allows investors to trade stocks with no fees at all. And these days, it seems hard not to talk about Robinhood without mentioning the effect of Reddit on the  stock market . For instance, shares of  AMC Entertainment  ( NYSE: AMC ) have gained considerable momentum recently.   Of course, there have been several tailwinds working in favor of AMC stock. For one, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated last week that vaccinated individuals are protected from the novel coronavirus. That signals to investors that movie theaters will get back to full capacity.   Perhaps, another contributing factor to AMC’s recent rise has been the capital raise, further boosting its balance sheet. But many would agree that AMC stock continued its rally amid a renewed push on Reddit to squeeze short-sellers. Considering all these factors, it should not come as no surprise why AMC stock is one of the  top Robinhood stocks  to trade. But if you want a safer bet with promising returns in the long run, you might want to consider the following names.   Top Robinhood Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio     Apple  ( NASDAQ: AAPL )   Tesla  ( NASDAQ: TSLA )    Microsoft  ( NASDAQ: MSFT )   Amazon.com  ( NASDAQ: AMZN )   Walt Disney  ( NYSE: DIS )    Apple    First up, Apple is a market leader in personal computers and consumer electronic products. The demand for the company’s products has drastically increased because of the pandemic.     As a result, the company’s second fiscal quarter earnings came in with record revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Out of which, 67% is from international revenues. Also, Apple recently introduced several new products and services that should boost its growth. These include the AirTag tracking device and Apple Podcasts Subscriptions.  Of course, there are also rumors that Apple could be launching augmented reality devices in the coming years. With such exciting developments, would AAPL stock see more gains as the year progresses?

No doubt, Tesla’s $1.5 billion purchase of the cryptocurrency and subsequent sale of a chunk of its holdings led to a $101 million accounting boost. But let’s be real here, making electric vehicles is the story investors should be focusing on. From its most recent quarter, Tesla’s revenue came in 76% higher year-over-year. Deliveries are up 109% while first-quarter orders were the strongest in the company’s history. Simply put, Tesla is firing on all cylinders. But not everyone seems to share the same view.     Famed investor Michael Burry, one of the first investors to call and profit from the subprime mortgage crisis, placed a $530 million bet against Tesla. Will he succeed again this time? I don’t know about you, but the numbers from Tesla’s earnings this week seem to suggest that the growth trajectory remains robust for the near term.  Could the recent weakness be a buy-on-dip opportunity for investors? Or should investors thread with caution as Burry warned investors that Tesla’s reliance on regulatory credits to generate profits is a red flag? Burry proved many wrong with the mortgage crisis while Musk burnt many short-sellers over the past few years. Which side would you be taking?

Not many tech stocks could claim the same track record of success as Microsoft has. From its most recent quarter fiscal, the company posted annualized revenue growth of 19%. This marks its biggest quarterly increase since 2018. According to CEO Satya Nadella, massive strides in Microsoft’s gaming and cloud divisions are to thank for this performance.      Also, the tech giant is reportedly working with the U.K.-based creative tech company WPP to “ transform creative content production ”. The duo launched Cloud Studio, an innovative cloud platform focused on advertising content creation.  According to Microsoft, teams from across WPP’s global network can now produce campaigns for clients from any location around the world.

Despite being known for its e-commerce influence, the company has a strong presence in other industries as well. Notably, the company is a major player in cloud computing and digital streaming as well.     From its most recent quarter, net sales came in 44% higher to $108.52 compared to the prior year. The company’s net income for the quarter increased to $8.1 billion. Its cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services in particular saw significant customer momentum, with new commitments and migrations from customers spanning many major industries.  In detail, AWS has become a $54 billion annual sales run rate business. It also enjoyed a 32% growth year-over-year. Separately, reports said Amazon is in talks to acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie studio behind the James Bond series. If the deal goes through, it could be a huge boost to Amazon’s streaming business. For these reasons, will you consider adding AMZN stock to your watchlist?   Walt Disney   One of the more popular names in Robinhood is Walt Disney. Sure, the company was hit hard by the novel coronavirus. However, things are returning to normal as the expansive campaign of vaccination should help Disney regain its stride. Investors are increasingly optimistic with DIS stock as Disneyland in California is now open. With the summer holiday just a few weeks away, we could see an increase in traffic in its theme parks. And that should bode well for DIS stock.     Disney has plenty of growth opportunities over the next decade and beyond as the entertainment powerhouse shifted its focus to its streaming platform, Disney+. Its ability to boast a total global subscriber count of 100 million subscribers is something worth cheering on.  Management expects the service to boast 230 million to 260 million subscribers by 2024. Given that theme parks, experiences, and product segments are one step closer to delivering the levels of revenue they did in the past, would you consider buying DIS stock?

However, if we are looking at it long-term, this could present as a buying opportunity. Given how tech has reshaped our life, it is quite unlikely that this will change anytime soon. Any new advancements in today’s world would likely be some new technological breakthrough. Even healthcare is heavily influenced by tech, which is why the biotech industry has been booming. With some of the top tech stocks trading below their previously sky-high valuations, investors may see this as a potential to buy the dip.   The sector includes companies with the largest market capitalizations such as Microsoft Corporation ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon.com Inc ( NASDAQ: AMZN ).  It should not come as a surprise that both companies have seen significant gains in their stock valuation over the past year. During this period, both MSFT stock and AMZN stock have risen by over 30%. This is no small feat as these are stocks that have already been at the top for quite some time. So, this goes to show that the sky’s the limit when it comes to tech stocks. All things considered, are these the  best tech stocks to buy  in the stock market today?   Best Tech Stocks To Buy [Or Avoid] Right Now     Apple Inc  ( NASDAQ: AAPL )   Cisco Systems Inc  ( NASDAQ: CSCO )   Snowflake Inc  ( NYSE: SNOW )   Analog Devices, Inc  ( NASDAQ: ADI )    Apple Inc    First, to make the list, we have the tech titan that requires no introduction, Apple. It is considered one of the “ Big Five ” companies in the U.S. information technology industry. The company designs and markets mobile devices and personal computers. On top of that, it also sells a range of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. Now let us look at its recent financial figures reported in April. Apple posted a record quarterly revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Out of which, 67% of its revenue is international. AAPL stock has risen by more than 60% over the past year.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS As you would expect, Apple has the internet buzzing every other day. Recently, the company teased a special announcement with the tagline “ Get Ready – Music is About to Change Forever ”. This could be the introduction of lossless audio or a 3D option for Apple Music with an animated video embedded in the macOS and iOS Music apps.  This indicates that users will be able to stream songs at higher quality and potentially enjoy them in some form of Spatial Audio using Dolby Atmos with the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Therefore, despite still facing a global shortage of semiconductors, the company continues to innovate. Given all that, would you consider AAPL stock a top tech stock to buy?

The company engages in designing and selling a range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications, and the cloud. Its product and technologies include infrastructure platforms; applications; security and other products. It is worth noting that Cisco will be reporting its earnings this Wednesday. Cisco’s fiscal third-quarter results will likely reflect its momentum in web security, unified threat, and network security and advanced threat offerings. This is due to increased spending on cybersecurity as employees work remotely. The stock has been up by over 20% since the start of the year.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Are there signs to show this continuous uptrend for the year? The company is on a flurry of acquisition intentions for the past week. Last Friday, Cisco announced its intent to purchase privately-held Kenna Security. Kenna specializes in risk-based vulnerability management. This will fundamentally strengthen Cisco’s platform experience by giving customers the ability to prioritize vulnerabilities based on a robust risk methodology.  In the same week, the company also announced its intent to acquire Socio Labs to power the future of hybrid events. The solution will enable live streaming, sponsorship, networking, and advanced analytics, along with continuous engagement before, during, and after events.

Snowflake is often credited with reviving the data warehouse industry by building and perfecting a cloud-based data platform.

        "content": "  Top Tech Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Today    Investing in tech stocks in the  stock market  has not been as smooth sailing as it was last year. The sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services in industries such as information technology, software, computers, and many more. It is hard to imagine not having some form of technological influence in businesses today. Due to this fact itself, it is not a surprise that the sector includes companies with the largest market capitalizations such as  Microsoft Corporation  ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and  Amazon.com  ( NASDAQ: AMZN ).    Today, even fast-food giants  McDonald’s  ( NYSE: MCD ) is utilizing technology to improve customer experience and boost revenues. The company uses predictive analytics &amp; machine learning to display food options onto outdoor digital drive-thru menus based on the weather, time of day, trending menu items, and current restaurant traffic. This allows McDonald’s to create a more personal experience for their customers. In fact, this is only made possible after the acquisition of digital customer experience technology company Dynamic Yield.  All in all, technological news continues to grab headlines this year. Do you agree that tech will continue to be an integral part of our lives? If so, could these  top tech stocks  be worth your attention in the   stock market today?   Top Tech Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Today      Apple Inc  ( NASDAQ: AAPL )   Snowflake Inc  ( NYSE: SNOW )   Arista Networks Inc  ( NYSE: ANET )   Twitter Inc  ( NYSE: TWTR )     Apple Inc    To start off the list, we have the tech giant that needs no introduction, Apple. As most of us would know, the company designs and markets mobile devices, personal computers, and digital music players. The company announced its fiscal Q2 earnings last week. Apple posted a quarter record revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Out of which, 67% is from international revenues. Similar to many tech stocks, AAPL stock has seen significant gains over the past year. It has risen by an impressive 70% during the period.      On Wednesday, Apple awarded an additional $410 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to II-VI ( NASDAQ: IIVI ), a leading manufacturer of optical technology. II-VI manufactures vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that help power Face ID, Memoji, Animoji, and Portrait mode selfies. This extended collaboration will undoubtedly create additional capacity and accelerate the delivery of future components for the iPhone.  Furthermore, Apple also announced last week that it will accelerate its U.S. investments. It plans to make new contributions of more than $430 billion over the next five years. This includes tens of billions of dollars for next-generation silicon development and 5G innovations. As a result, this will create more job opportunities as well as investment in next-generation innovative businesses. With that in mind, is this the right time to buy AAPL stock?

Snowflake is often credited with reviving the data warehouse industry by building and perfecting a cloud-based data platform.      In March, the company reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financials for fiscal 2021. Impressively, revenue for the quarter was $190.5 million, an increase of 117% year-over-year. Snowflake also said its net revenue retention rate was 168%, a respectable achievement. The company said that it now has 4,139 total customers, a 73% year-over-year growth.  Back In February, Snowflake and BlackRock ( NYSE: BLK ) announced a strategic partnership. In detail, BlackRock would launch Aladdin Data Cloud, a solution for investment managers to expand the utility of data, powered by Snowflake’s platform. The partnership aims to make data more accessible and actionable for the investment management community.  Separately, with the company reporting earnings on May 26, will you consider adding SNOW stock to your watchlist?

In detail, it uses software innovations to address the needs of Internet companies, cloud service providers, and data centers for enterprise support. At the core of Arista’s platform is the Extensible Operating System (EOS™). It is a ground-breaking network operating system with single-image consistency across hardware platforms, and a modern open core architecture enabling in-service upgrades and application extensibility. Arista is another company that announced its Q1 results this week. The company posted revenue of $667.6 million, an increase of 27.6% from the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the company reported a healthy operating profit of $198.8 million for the quarter.       This goes to show that customers are responding to the company’s focus on cognitive cloud networking suites. It is also noteworthy that the company has performed well throughout the pandemic, and this recent earnings report is the sixth consecutive quarter that the company has beaten analysts’ expectations.  Furthermore, in early April, Arista announced CloudVision 2021. CloudVision is a multi-domain management plane that enables operations consistency across data centers, campus wired and wireless, and public cloud use cases. This uniform approach would simplify network operations for Arista’s customers and partners. With that in mind, would you consider investing in ANET stock?    [Read More]   Top Video Game Stocks To Watch After Activision Blizzard Beat Estimates    Twitter Inc    Last but not least, we have Twitter.

In late April, the company announced its first-quarter financial results. Revenue for the quarter was up by 28% year-over-year, coming in at $1.04 billion. Net income was $68 million, representing a net margin of 7%. This compares to a net loss of $8 million for the same period last year. Safe to say, if you had invested in TWTR stock a year ago, it would’ve been a sound investment. The stock has almost doubled in price over the past year.   With that being said, the company is not taking anything for granted and still strives to improve its software. Twitter’s acquisition spree continued on Tuesday, where it acquired a news tech company, Scroll. This is a subscription service that offers its users a better way to read through long-form content on the web by removing ads. The service will become a part of Twitter’s larger plans to invest in subscriptions. Given the prospect for growth of the company, would you consider adding TWTR stock to your portfolio?

        "content": "  Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch In May 2021   As  tech stocks  continue to recover from this week’s losses, investors may be looking towards   Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks  . Why? In short, this section of the  stock market  could be under the microscope thanks to a recent market research note. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the global AI in health care market could grow to a mind-blowing $107.79 billion by 2027. To put things into perspective, this segment of the AI industry was valued at about $3.9 billion back in 2019. In theory, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of about 49.8% from 2020 to 2027. With AI boasting this much potential, I could see investors looking for the best AI stocks to buy in the  stock market today .  For starters, AI companies such as Veeva ( NYSE: VEEV ) are already helping some of the top medical organizations in the world. Namely, Veeva helps healthcare giants optimize their operations across the board via AI and cloud-computing tech. Just this week, Veeva revealed that it is working with 6 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, cybersecurity firms like Palo Alto Networks ( NYSE: PANW ) heavily rely on AI to bolster their services. These are but two instances where AI plays a key role in evolving industries. Generally, as systems get more complex over time, the need for AI would increase as well, regardless of industry. With that in mind, here are four  top AI stocks  worth looking at in the stock market now.   Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch     Amazon.com Inc.  ( NASDAQ: AMZN )   Nvidia Corporation  ( NASDAQ: NVDA )   IBM Corporation  ( NYSE: IBM )   Apple Inc.  ( NASDAQ: AAPL )    Amazon.com Inc.   Amazon is a multinational tech company that is based in Seattle, Washington. The tech giant focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming and is often referred to as one of the most influential companies in the world. Also, it has recently made huge strides into the AI sector as well. Specifically, it does this through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provides machine learning services and supporting cloud infrastructure to clients. AMZN stock currently trades at $3,192.22 as of 10:07 a.m. ET.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Late last month, the company announced its first-quarter financials for 2021. In it, Amazon reported that net sales increased by 44% year-over-year to $108.5 billion. Net income for the quarter increased to $8.1 billion, or $15.79 per diluted share. AWS in particular saw significant customer momentum, with new commitments and migrations from customers spanning many major industries.  In detail, AWS has become a $54 billion annual sales run rate business in competing against the world’s largest technology companies. It also enjoyed a 32% growth year-over-year. For these reasons, will you consider adding AMZN stock to your watchlist?

As companies are increasingly data-driven, the demand for AI technology grows. From speech recognition and recommender systems to medical imaging and improved supply chain management, Nvidia is providing companies with the necessary tools for today’s economy. NVDA stock currently trades at $556.85 as of 10:16 a.m. ET and has been up by over 65% in the last year.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Earlier this month, the company released a blog post on integrating AI into retail with Walmart’s ( NYSE: WMT ) Grant Gelvin. The post highlights the growing importance of AI on improving everything from customer experience to stocking and item pricing. Gelvin’s most recent project has been a dynamic pricing system, which reduces excess food waste by pricing perishable goods at a cost to ensure that they will be sold.  In February, Nvidia announced its fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results as well. It reported a record quarterly and full-year revenue for the company and its Gaming and Data Center segments. Quarterly revenue was $5 billion, a 61% increase year-over-year. Full-year revenue was a whopping $16.68 billion, up by 53% year-over-year. With so many exciting things happening to Nvidia, will you be on the lookout for NVDA stock?

It has operations in over 170 countries. The company’s AI platform is called Watson and is powered by the latest innovations in machine learning. Watson is an open, multi-cloud platform that automates the AI lifecycle. It can help customers increase productivity, improve customer service, and also enhance financial services. IBM stock currently trades at $144.56 as of 10:16 a.m. ET.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS In April, the company announced its first-quarter financials for 2021. Firstly, the company posted a revenue of $17.7 billion for the quarter. A chunk of this revenue came from its cloud segment, at $6.5 billion is up by 21% year-over-year. IBM also ended the quarter with $11.3 billion of cash on hand and reduced its debt by $5.1 billion since the end of 2020.  “ Strong performance this quarter in cloud, driven by increasing client adoption of our hybrid cloud platform, and growth in software and consulting enabled us to get off to a solid start for the year, ” said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, and chief executive officer. “ While we have more work to do, we are confident we can achieve full-year revenue growth and meet our adjusted free cash flow target in 2021 .” For these reasons, will you consider watching IBM stock?   Apple Inc.   Another top name in the field now would be Apple. Now, although most would not immediately think of AI when looking at Apple, the tech giant employs it regularly, nonetheless. In fact, the company is actively using AI tech to improve user experiences in several ways. Some notable applications include facial recognition, native sleep tracking, app suggestions, and even handwriting recognition. The likes of which are found across all of Apple’s flagship consumer electronic devices. By and large, this would give investors another reason to be watching AAPL stock right now.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS While all this is great, Apple still finds ways to broaden and refine its AI endeavors. Last week, the company reportedly hired former Google ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) AI scientist, Samy Bengio. According to Reuters, Bengio would likely be leading a new AI research unit at Apple.  If anything, this play would synergize well with the company’s recent $430 billion investment plans involving AI research. Despite not being a pure-play AI investment, Apple appears to be doubling down on AI research regardless. Could this make AAPL stock a top AI stock now?

The explosion in consumer electronics and device usage has been a key growth driver, especially with consumers adopting  work-learn-engage at home  trends. The maker of electronic circuit boards is a key component provider and supplier to major brands including  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,  Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ,  Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HP) ,  Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) . The Company is set to gain on the growth in electronics powered by  digital transformation  and  5G  adoption, constrained by  global chip shortage  of 2021. The  re-openings  are being accelerated from  COVID vaccinations . Prudent investors looking to capture gains from the momentum in secular growth trends in healthcare, automotive and 5G adoption can monitor shares of Jabil Circuit for opportunistic pullbacks.

Conference Call Takeaways   Jabil CEO Mark Mondello set the tone, “Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient; this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption of cyclical demand. Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers. It’s a proven formula that’s trusted by many of the world’s most remarkable companies.” CEO Mondello went on to point out the efforts of the past several years have enabled the Company to expand its industry segment base and align with secular trends including 5G, personalized healthcare, digital learning, electric vehicles, cloud computing, clean energy, and eco-friendly packaging.   Secular Trends Driving Growth   Jabil CFO Mike Dastoor summed up the long-term secular trends that will drive growth for many years to come. In  healthcare , companies are shifting from manufacturing to connected product solutions. In the automotive industry, electric vehicles are a major driver making up only 2% of total vehicles currently, “Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies.” The adoption of 5G is accelerating, “5G will transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out.” This also contributes to further migration and expansion of the  cloud , “This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping up grow market shares in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years.”        JBL Opportunistic Pullback Levels   Using  the rifle charts  on the weekly and daily time frames provides a precision view of the landscape for JBL stock.

Featured Article:   Stock Market - What is a circuit breaker?    7 Low-Priced Dividend Stocks Under $10   The recent trading activity surrounding low-priced stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a reminder to investors of the high-risk nature involved with these stocks. Often when a stock trades for under $10 (also termed a penny stock), it is trading that low for a reason. The company may not be profitable, or in the case of GameStop, it finds itself with a business model that no longer fits with consumer trends.  But that’s not always the case. It is possible to find low-priced stocks, even penny stocks, that offer great value. This is particularly true if the stock offers investors a dividend. Dividend-earning stocks are a diversification source for a consumer’s portfolio, particularly if the dividend gets reinvested. It’s literally like paying yourself for owning the stock.  And the stocks in this presentation look ready also to deliver some additional stock price growth that can increase your total return.   View the \"7 Low-Priced Dividend Stocks Under $10\" .

        "content": "        Bloomin’ Brands Business Blossoms, But Shares Down In May        Share                 Thursday, May 13, 2021  |   Kate Stalter     Restaurant chain operator  Bloomin’ Brands (NASDAQ: BLMN)  brands is consolidating below its April 30 high of $32.81, which it reached a day after reporting first-quarter results.  The company’s brands include Outback Steakhouse, Fleming’s, Bonefish Grill, Aussie Grill and Carrabba’s Italian Grill.   Despite taking a drubbing during the pandemic, like all restaurants, Bloomin’ Brands has been a growth-stock success story. The company notched a series of positive returns over various rolling time frames:    3 months:  25.80%   Year-to-date:  51.65%   One year:  158.11%   However, growth stocks as an asset class have been getting hammered since a late April rally attempt fizzled. The Nasdaq Composite is down 5.31% in May, slumping 5.85% as of mid-session Wednesday  As three-fourths of stocks typically follow the broader market’s direction, either higher or lower, it’s no surprise to see stocks like Bloomin’ Brands skidding as big techs lead the market lower. For example,  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  is down 5.95% for the month, and  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)  is down 4.34%.  Bloomin’s earnings report offered much to cheer about. The company posted revenue of $987.5 million, down 2% from a year ago, when pandemic lockdowns struck toward the end of the quarter.   It marked the third quarter in a row of sequential revenue gains, illustrating gradual improvement as customers return to reopened restaurants.   The company reported a rapid increase in weekly per-store sales volume, which rose from  $21,000 to $35,000 in the four weeks prior to April 28.   Earnings per share  came in at $0.63 per share, up a whopping 350% from a year ago.   Analysts expect earnings of $2.20 a share this year, and $2.43 a share in 2022. Both numbers were revised higher recently.   In the earnings call,  executive vice president and chief financial officer Chris Meyer said off-premise dining - also known as takeout - comprised 35% of earnings in the quarter, down only 2% from the fourth quarter, when dine-in options were more restricted. Meyer said the company is planning for takeout business to be a significant revenue stream going forward, even as indoor dining continues to reopen.   “This occasion is proving to be highly incremental and will remain a key part of our growth strategy moving forward,” he said.  Meyer cited another milestone. “We ended the quarter with 100% of our domestic company-owned restaurants open with in-restaurant dining,” he said.   Even as Covid restrictions ease and Americans are ready to dine in restaurants again, a fresh crop of challenges have emerged. One of the biggest is higher food prices as commodity prices rise and there’s now a shortage of chickens. Another looming challenge is higher labor expenses.  Both of those could have an impact on Bloomin’s bottom line, resulting in a potentially lower earnings number for the year.   Of course, rival restaurant chains are facing those same headwinds. But Bloomin’ Brands may have an advantage over competitors, when it comes to staffing.   “We did not furlough any employees during the pandemic, and this decision has contributed to low turnover,” said CEO David Deno, in the earnings call.   “Maintaining a motivated and well-trained and engaged employee base is critical to our long-term success. As sales volumes are now exceeding pre pandemic levels, these actions provide a competitive advantage to retaining talent as the industry faces some staffing challenges,” Deno added.   Bloomin’ shares are down 10% so far in May, underperforming the wider group of publicly traded restaurants, down just 2.6%. With a beta of 1.55, the stock is more volatile than the broader market, so it’s not necessarily a surprise to see the underperformance.   While the stock is currently trading below its late April high, it’s not yet etching a proper base. At this juncture, the stock is still in the “falling knife” category, meaning would-be investors should track the stock, waiting until it begins its next upward trajectory before jumping in.   In the current market environment, coupled with higher commodity prices that are a real threat to restaurant-industry profits, you also want to see a broad market rally to buoy this stock.     Featured Article:   What is a CD ladder?    7 Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks That Have Real Juice   I’ll start with a disclaimer. You won’t see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Nio (NYSE:NIO) on this list. And that’s not because I’m being contrarian. I just view Tesla and Nio as the known quantities in the electric vehicle sector. The goal of this presentation is to help you identify stocks that may be flying under your radar.  Many EV stocks went public in 2020 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). There is both good and bad to that story. The good is that investors have many options for investing in the EV sector. Many of the companies that have entered the market are attempting to carve out a specific niche.  The potentially bad news is that these stocks are very speculative in nature. Whereas companies like Tesla and Nio have a proven (albeit recent) track record, there are things like revenue and orders that investors can analyze. With many of these newly public companies, investors are being asked to buy the story more than the stock and that is always risky.  However, in this special presentation, we’ve identified seven companies that look like they have a story that is compelling enough that investors should be rewarded in 2021.

        "content": "  Why Are Investors Eyeing These Semiconductor Stocks Right Now?   Semiconductor stocks performed extremely well last year in the  stock market , and analysts are expecting more great things in the space in 2021. And the reason is quite simple. While it’s no secret that semiconductor chips are in demand right now, not every stock in the industry is trending up. This is largely due to the chip shortage and chip manufacturing companies’ unable to keep up with its demand. The world we live in today revolves around the semiconductor industry. This ranges from our smart devices and home appliances to modes of transportation we utilize daily. So it should not come as a surprise that demand for chips is at an all-time high.   Having said that, many companies that heavily rely on these chips such as   Apple   ( NASDAQ: AAPL ) and   Samsung   ( OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) were not negatively affected significantly. Apple still reported soaring revenues and record Mac sales in its previous quarter despite the lack of chips which is hampering the production of iPads and Mac computers. Meanwhile, Samsung’s digital appliances business President, Lee Jae-Seung, expects the pandemic-induced home appliance sales boom to extend till the second half of 2021. Samsung’s home appliance operating profit rose over two-fold year-over-year to $357.71 million. All things considered, do you have this list of top  semiconductor stocks  to buy in the stock market today?   Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Today     NVIDIA Corporation  ( NASDAQ: NVDA )   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  ( NYSE: TSM )   Intel Corporation  ( NASDAQ: INTC )   ON Semiconductor Corp  ( NASDAQ: ON )    NVIDIA    First up, we have semiconductor giant   Nvidia  . The company focuses on personal computer graphics, graphics processing units (GPU), and artificial intelligence (AI). Its GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets. These include GeForce for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists. NVDA stock has almost doubled over the past year and appears to be testing its all-time high soon.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Investors have been waiting for its first-quarter earnings report. And it did not disappoint. Nvidia’s overall revenue hiked by 84% for the quarter, with the gaming segment up by 106% and its data center business up by 79%. Furthermore, its diluted earnings per share increased to a historic $3.03, up by 106%. This is impressive even by its existing high standards.  Some investors may have been expecting a deceleration in demand for processors used in gaming but reported financials have proven the doubters wrong. Nvidia also reiterated that the company is expected to vote on a four-for-one-stock split during its upcoming shareholders’ meeting on June 3. So, would this make NVDA stock a buy for you?   [Read More]   5 Top Health Care Stocks To Watch Ahead Of June 2021    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing   Next, we have the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world,   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing   (TSM). In essence, it engages in the manufacturing and sale of integrated circuits and semiconductors. Also, it offers customer service, account management, and engineering services. Given the increasing demand for semiconductors due to the chip shortage, you would expect that TSM would benefit greatly from it.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS TSM stock has flattered to deceive since the start of the year despite its strong fundamentals. That said, the stock has more than doubled in price over the past year. In addition, Japan’s government has recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony Group ( NYSE: SONY ) to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant. However, TSM has declined to comment and did not elaborate further.  Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April. Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion. Thus, with its market-leading position in a high-demand sector, would you consider buying TSM stock?   Read More     Top Growth Stocks To Watch In June 2021    Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? 4 Streaming Stocks To Know     Intel      Intel   is a company that engages in designing and manufacturing products and technologies for cloud, smart, and connected devices. It offers platform products, such as central processing units (CPU) and chipsets, and system-on-chip and multichip packages. On top of that, it also offers non-platform or adjacent products comprising accelerators, boards and systems, connectivity products, and memory and storage products.  Source: TD Ameritrade TOS Earlier this month, the company announced that it will invest $3.5 billion to equip its New Mexico operations for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor packaging technologies. This includes Foveros, Intel’s breakthrough 3D packaging technology. This is significant as investing in its manufacturing operations is an essential component of its recently announced IDM 2.0 strategy.  Indeed, Intel has not been flourishing as compared to its main rival Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ: AMD ). If anything, INTC stock has been moving sideways for the past few years. However, Intel remains the largest provider of core processors for “x86” personal computers and servers. And most personal computers run on Microsoft Corporation’s ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows operating system. With that in mind, would you bet on INTC stock’s future?   [Read More]   Hot Stocks To Buy Now? 5 Cyclical Stocks To Watch    ON Semiconductor    To sum up the list, we have   ON Semiconductor  . The company offers a portfolio of sensors, power management, connectivity, custom and system on chip (SoC), analog, logic, timing, and custom devices. Basically, its products aim to help engineers solve their unique design challenges in various applications. The company is also currently among the top 10 global automotive semiconductor suppliers in terms of sales and revenue.   Source: TD Ameritrade TOS On Wednesday, ON Semiconductor along with Ambarella inc ( NASDAQ: AMBA ), and Lumentum Holdings Inc ( NASDAQ: LITE ) have announced two new joint reference designs to fast-track Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) device distribution. This would increase the accuracy of AIoT devices across application verticals, starting with biometric access control and electronic locks. Hence enabling them to recognize people and predict their needs.   ON Semiconductor also reported its first-quarter financial report earlier this month. It boasted revenue of $1.48 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Out of which, automotive revenue was $515 million, up 5% from the previous quarter. Most impressively, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35. That compares favorably to a measly $0.10 in the same quarter a year ago. It appears that disciplined execution in a high-demand environment across its end markets is the driving force for these strong results. All things considered, would you invest in ON stock?

        "content": "  These Communication Stocks Are Trending In The Stock Market This Week   In a world where social distancing is a necessity and countries around the world moving in and out of lockdown, alternative ways of communication become even more important. This is where  communication stocks  come into the limelight in the  stock market . These include companies from telecommunications to social media and news outlets. The sector has evolved as the pandemic affected everyone’s lives. Fortunately, it evolved for the better, as it allowed people to explore other ways of communication. For instance, online services are being utilized more than ever after the world went into lockdown. Hence, many top communication stocks increased in value on rising demand for their services.   Take Twitter Inc ( NYSE: TWTR ) and Snap Inc ( NYSE: SNAP ) for example. People who invested in these two companies over the past year would’ve seen significant profit. SNAP stock has risen by over 200% for the past year while TWTR stock has risen by over 80% in the same period. Thus, it is understandable that investors would be keen to invest in the  top communication stocks  in the   stock market today  . In light of that, here are four names you should be aware of.    Top Communication Stocks To Watch Now     Zoom Video Communications Inc  ( NASDAQ: ZM )   Roku Inc  ( NASDAQ: ROKU )   iHeartMedia Inc  ( NASDAQ: IHRT )   Facebook, Inc  ( NASDAQ: FB )    Zoom Video Communications Inc    Zoom Video Communications is a provider of video-first communication platforms and web conferencing services. It offers a cloud-native platform, which unifies cloud video conferencing, online meetings, group messaging, and a software-based conference room system. This enables users to easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. There are not many companies that have benefitted from the global pandemic as much as Zoom. However, ZM stock has been trading sideways since the start of the year. This is likely due to COVID-19 restrictions easing up and people going back to in-person work. Naturally, investors may not be feeling too optimistic about ZM stock.      It’s worth pointing out that the management is currently projecting that revenue will grow 42% in fiscal 2022 to $3.77 billion. On top of that, Zoom is also introducing other growth initiatives such as Zoom Phone. So chances are, there is still space for growth ahead of this business. Last week, cybersecurity company Safeguard Cyber announced the introduction of its new Advanced Governance for Zoom Video Communications extension.  This augments the collaboration platform’s native security and compliance capabilities. With access to Zoom’s archive API, Safeguard delivers added security, cyber defense, compliance, and data protection. Given how important cyber-security is, this could ease users’ minds and could even encourage more users to use its platform. All things considered, is this a buying opportunity for ZM stock?    [Read More]   Stocks To Buy This Week? 4 Travel Stocks To Watch Before The Summer    Roku Inc    Next on the list, we have the pioneers of streaming on TV, Roku. The company produces streaming hardware and manages its proprietary streaming platform. Furthermore, it allows content publishers to build and monetize large audiences and provides advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers. In a nutshell, Roku facilitates content from other mainstream streaming services. This would include Netflix ( NASDAQ: NFLX ), Apple TV ( NASDAQ: AAPL ), and Disney+ ( NYSE: DIS ). Subsequently, the company receives a cut of subscription fees paid through its platform while gaining ad revenue from its free content. Hence this would put Roku in a strong position for growth regardless of which streaming company comes out on top.      It is no secret that ROKU stock has been performing relatively well for the past year. It is seeing gains of over 140% in this period. On top of that, the stock has been up by 11.55% upon Friday’s closing bell. This was likely driven by the recent first-quarter results announced by the company. In the report, revenues skyrocketed 79% from the year-ago quarter to $574.2 million.  Furthermore, usage was strong, it added 2.4 million accounts in the quarter, the number of accounts on the platform grew by 35% year-over-year. As it stands, Roku operating system (OS) is the number 1 smart TV OS in the U.S. All this coupled with the company’s profitability profile serves as a reminder to investors that Roku is well-positioned for the future. With that in mind, is ROKU stock a buy for you now?

Its leadership position in audio extends across multiple platforms including more than 860 live broadcast stations. The company’s iHeartRadio digital service is available across more than 250 platforms and 2,000 devices including smart speakers, smartphones, TVs, and even gaming consoles. As it stands, IHRT stock has been up by a staggering 240% over the past year.      Last Friday, iHeartMedia announced its first-quarter earnings, where it posted revenue of $706.67 million. The digital audio group maintained strong growth and profit trajectory, where revenues were up by 70% year-over-year. On top of that, podcast revenue was up by 142% for the past year.  Moving forward, the company launched the first-of-its-kind Private Marketplace for brands last week. This will allow brand advertisers to compose their specific audience targets and pricing depending on their marketing needs. Given the potential for growth within the industry, will you consider IHRT stock a top communication stock to buy?   [Read More]   Hot Stocks To Buy? 4 Growth Stocks To Watch    Facebook, Inc    To finish off the list, we have the social media giant that needs no introduction, Facebook. Impressively, the company’s products empower over 3 billion people around the world. Also, over 200 million businesses use its apps to connect with customers and grow.     Consumers from the U.S. indeed do most of their internet shopping with established platforms run by companies like Amazon.com Inc ( NASDAQ: AMZN ). However, in other regions of the world such as Southeast Asia, almost half of all e-commerce takes place through social media or chat rooms including on Facebook’s apps. Social commerce accounted for about 44% of Southeast Asia’s $109 billion e-commerce market last year, according to Bain &amp; Co.   From here, we can see that Facebook is not just a communication juggernaut, but it thrives in other areas as well. In April, the company announced its first-quarter earnings. It reported a revenue of $26.17 billion for the quarter, which was up 48% compared with the prior year. Also, net income grew by a whopping 94% to $9.5 billion. Given the endless possibilities with Facebook, would you be investing in FB stock?
